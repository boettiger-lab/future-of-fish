# New Decision Methods are Needed to Rebuild Global Fisheries

A repository containing code used in the manuscript, "New Decision Methods are Needed to Rebuild Global Fisheries"

Note: Code shown here relies on our implementation of the POMDP algorithm
for decision making under stochastic models with imperfect observations,
<https://github.com/boettiger-lab/sarsop>.  That repository provides a more
general-purpose interface to the algorithm as a stand-alone R package,
complete with documentation and tests.  

Code provided here shows how this and other decision algorithms were applied
to the RAM stock assessment data in our manuscript.
